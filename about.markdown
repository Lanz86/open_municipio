description: Notes about the Open municipio project
---


After [openparlamento](http://parlamento.openpolis.it)'s success, many of the users and associates of the Openpolis association asked us to do something similar for the Comune, which is the _nearest_ institution in Italy, 
but which lacks accessibility and transparency, especially for medium-sized towns and metropolies.

That is how Open municipio was born. The no-profit project, ideated together with [Informaetica](http://www.informaetica.it), that aims to open the politics and administrative peocesses of italian municipalities to the citizens, in order to increase the democratic partecipation level.


Open municipio is a web platform, fed by official political and administrative data, provided by those municipalities that join the project. Open standards and formats are used to distribute these data back to the citizens and free services are provided, in order to monitor and partecipate actively to the processes of the insitution.

Introduction
------------

After [openparlamento](http://parlamento.openpolis.it)'s success, many of the users and associates of the Openpolis association asked us to do something similar for the Comune, which from the citizen's perspective is certainly  the _nearest_ institution in Italy, 
but which lacks accessibility and transparency, especially in medium-sized towns and metropolies.

That is how Open municipio was born. A not for profit project, ideated together with [Informaetica](http://www.informaetica.it), it aims to open the politics and administrative processes of italian municipalities to the citizens, in order to increase the democratic partecipation level.


Open municipio is a web platform, fueled by official political and administrative data, provided by those municipalities that join the project. Open standards and formats are used to distribute these data back to the citizens and free services are provided, in order to monitor and partecipate actively to the processes of the insitutions.

Technologies
------------
Open municipio is a django project, developed on github, by a small team of experts and developers. It has been subdivided into applications, in order to keep thing simpler and to possibly re-use applications in other contexts.

    This is the base class for all the different act types: it contains the common fields for
    deliberations, interrogations, interpellations, motions, agendas and emendations.
  
    It is a ``TimeStampedModel``, so it tracks creation and modification timestamps for each record.

    The ``related_news`` attribute can be used  to fetch news related to a given act.

    Inheritance is done through multi-table inheritance, since browsing the whole set of acts may be useful.
    The default manager is the ``InheritanceManager`` (from package `django-model-utils`_),
    providing the ``select_subclasses()`` method, which allows the retrieval of concrete subclasses' instances, 
    if needed.
